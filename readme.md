## About project

This is a web engineering assignment that uses drag and drop items to create a simple GUI to generate and execute PHP code.

## Tools used

HTML/CSS have been used for the styling whereas Javascript has been used for the php code generation and drag-and-drop implementation. The generated php code runs on xammp/wamp servers.

## Components implemented

Different components of PHP language have been implemented. These are:

- Conditional statements
- Functions and function calls
- Arithmetic operations
- File handling
- Variable declaration and printing
- Loops

## Symantics

- $ (dollar sign) followed by a name, such as $name, represents a variable.
- Text in quotes, such as "name", represents strings.
- Whereas text without quotes or dollar sign is considered a number and is written as it is.

Unless the type is specifically mentioned in the placeholder text of input fields, the above conventions have to be kept in mind when entering data.

If specifically mentioned in the input fields as to what is required, then only the value shall be written and the symantics will be taken care of by the program.
